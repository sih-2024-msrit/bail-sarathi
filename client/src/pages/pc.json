The prosecution's case relies heavily on the confessions of the accused, which were obtained during their arrest. However, the defense argues that the confessions are unreliable due to the lack of independent witnesses and corroborating evidence. \n\n**Critical Aspects:**\n\n- **Lack of Independent Witnesses:** The absence of public witnesses to the arrest and recovery of stolen property weakens the prosecution's case.\n- **Contradictory Testimony:** The prosecution witnesses' testimonies are inconsistent and contain material contradictions, further undermining their credibility.\n- **Confessions as Primary Evidence:** The prosecution relies heavily on the accused's confessions, which are challenged by the defense as unreliable and obtained under duress.\n- **Habitual Offenders:** The prosecution alleges that the accused are habitual offenders of theft, which may have influenced the investigation and the recording of confessions.\n\n**Legal Precedents and Rationale:**\n\nThe judgment likely hinges on the admissibility and weight given to the accused's confessions. The court will consider legal precedents regarding the reliability of confessions obtained without independent corroboration and the potential for coercion during arrest.\n\n**Final Judgment and Rationale:**\n\nNo relevant information found. The provided text only presents arguments from the defense and does not include the court's final judgment or rationale.",
